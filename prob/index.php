			<b>To know where to focus our efforts and to get more of us in development</b>
			Mortality data answers critical questions like these, helping us understand how many people are dying and – importantly – why. These data are relied on by researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians, policymakers, and many others working to identify problems, find solutions, and save lives.

<div class="col-md-8"><h2 class="head2">Global Death</h2>
<p class="mypara">n 2017, around 56 million people died – nearly half of these were aged 70 years or older; 27% aged 50-69; 14% aged 15-49; only 1% aged 5-14; and around 10% were children under the age of 5. In the chart below we see a breakdown of global deaths by cause, ordered from highest to lowest. This is shown in absolute numbers, and each cause as a share of total deaths. Note that this list is not exhaustive: deaths from less common causes are not shown</p>
<br>
<p class="mypara">
	There are a number of causes with high death tolls which if not entirely preventable can be (and have been in many countries) dramatically reduced. Approximately 1.8 million newborns still died due to complications at birth. The very low neonatal death rates in high-income countries and significant progress across the world in recent decades is testament to the fact that we know how to reduce such tragedies significantly. Similarly, diarrheal diseases — which claimed 1.6 million people in 2017 and is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years old — are also preventable and treatable through improved water, sanitation, hygiene, and simple ‘oral rehydration salt’ (ORS) packets. Malaria has been successfully eliminated in some regions, and should with time be possible to eradicate; nonetheless, the IHME’s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates that around 620,000 still died from malaria in 2017.
